# CS235-Final

This is for UC, Riverside CS 235 Data Mining Techniques Final Project: **Why Are Tree-Based Methods Effective for Structural Data Modeling: An Exploration**

The [codes folder](https://github.com/rwang92/CS235-Final/tree/master/Codes) contains the Python codes for the three simulations (packages needed: Python:`PyTorch, Numpy, Matplotlib`,`CUDA`).

To run the codes for simulation studies, we highly recommend to use Colaborary by Google instead of running on local machine to bypass the possible problems related to dependent packages like CUDA:

[Simulation 1](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XJXgkvvBrvHGUcL8JVH22r0I_fGUL1SB)

[Simulation 2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UfQUzvcUWs7hYEqx8UXgOQd-TREJZIZP)

[Simulation 3](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14Seu-Z_fKeGu0LSVkyiaWvDuhnbtBH6I)

The [real data experiment folder](https://github.com/rwang92/CS235-Final/tree/master/real%20data%20experiment) contains the codes for implementing SNN, NN and HME on [Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction). Since the whole dataset is too large to load in local machine, we just run the codes on the Kaggle Kernel. Please check the results from project report on iLearn.
