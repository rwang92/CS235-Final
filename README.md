# CS235-Final

This is for UC, Riverside CS 235 Data Mining Techniques Final Project: **Why Are Tree-Based Methods Effective for Structural Data Modeling: An Exploration**

The codes folder contains the Python codes for the three simulations (packages needed: Python:`PyTorch, Numpy, Matplotlib`,`CUDA`).

To run the codes for simulation studies, we highly recommend to use Colaborary by Google instead of running on local machine to bypass the possible problem related to dependent packages:

Simulation 1
Simulation 2
Simulation 3

The real data experiment folder contains the codes for implementing SNN, NN and HME on [Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction). Since the whole dataset is too large to load in local machine, we just run the codes on the Kaggle Kernel.
